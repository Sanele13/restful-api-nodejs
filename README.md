# restful-api-nodejs
This is API for the AngulaCLI tutorial, The Tour of Heroes.

Okay, here's what you need to do:
1. git clone https://github.com/Sanele13/restful-api-nodejs.git
2. npm install
3. node server.js

I'm using this with the Tour of Heroes tutorial, so maybe you might wanna go modify that. It's on the HTTP section. Bye now!
